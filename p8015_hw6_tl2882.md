Problem 1
=========

Tidy data
---------

``` r
data = 
  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  unite(city_state, city, state, sep = ", ") %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>% 
  mutate(bi_disposition = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")) %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white") ) %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white")) %>% 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by

Model for Baltimore, MD
-----------------------

``` r
model = glm(bi_disposition ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
            data = filter(data, city_state == "Baltimore, MD"), family = binomial(link = "logit"))
result = broom::tidy(model, conf.int = TRUE)

result %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-white") %>%
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate), 
         conf_low = exp(conf.low), conf_high = exp(conf.high)) %>% 
  select(odds_ratio, conf_low, conf_high) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

|  odds\_ratio|  conf\_low|  conf\_high|
|------------:|----------:|-----------:|
|     0.440608|  0.3121625|   0.6196693|

This is the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims keeping all other variables fixed.

Model for all cities
